## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow (it was pretty efficient but desktop first allows to build down instead of up.)

### What I learned
- I learned to structure almost anything woth flexbox. (Hope it's not too much).
- Background image positioning.
- I learned about sass as recommended by Frontend Mentor.
- By watching a 5 hours video of coder coder on freecodecamp channel where she worked on a frontend mentor project using `scss`.
- And another 2 hours video by codestackr on Yt.

### Continued development

I'll be using desktop-first interchangeably for now and probably start using `Sass` in my subsequent projects.
