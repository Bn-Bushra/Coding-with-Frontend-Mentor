## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup.
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt the importance of design for a web developer. Design serve as a visual aid and makes the destination achievable.

I also learnt that structuring with HTML is key. See how I utilised semantism here.

```html
<div class="background">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="image">
      <img src="./images/image-qr-code.png" alt="qr-code" />
    </div>
    <div class="image-text">
      <div class="heading"></div>
      <div class="paragraph"></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

I used css flexbox to center the qr code container.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I'll like to master CSS flex box and grid very well to be able to use efficiently and understand the working priciples of CSS.
