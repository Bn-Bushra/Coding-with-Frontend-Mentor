## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - Tailwind CSS

### Continued development

It took me a while to push this because I've been learning new technologies like React JS coupled with Tailwind and I'll be dropping future projects in it. Since React is in high demand, I am looking forward to upping my game in the industry.

### Useful resources

- [Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bxmDnn7lrnk) - This helped me for getting Started with Tailwind CSS. I really liked it, as it helped on and running with tailwind for the first time. I'll will be adding to the list of my tech stack, cuz I used it to build this webpage.
- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This is an amazing documentation which helped me understand Tailwind CSS. I'd recommend it to anyone starting out to learn Tailwind.
