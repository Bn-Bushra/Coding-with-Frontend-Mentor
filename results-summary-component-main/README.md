## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### Learnings

While working on this project, I learned how to dynamically update HTML content using data fetched from a local JSON file. Understanding the structure of the data and manipulating the DOM elements accordingly was a key takeaway.

### Future Development

Areas for future improvement include refining styles, enhancing accessibility, learning a CSS preprocessor language, APIs and exploring additional interactivity.
